# Identification-of-driving-Patterns
This repository is for my bachelors thesis with the aim to identify driving patterns on roundabouts

# Abstract
Increased traffic demand due to urbanization is leading to more complex intersections such as roundabouts. The driving behaviours and patterns at these intersections must be understood to support the smart infrastructure and make the future of automated traffic safe. The ability of machine learning (ML) methods to create models that recognize complex patterns from large amounts of data with a relatively small amount of effort quickly led to their adoption in many real-world applications. This study analyzes large amounts of unlabelled trajectory data using ML and clustering techniques to identify functional patterns. After discussing the methods in the literature, K means, Fuzzy c-means and Affinity Propagation are chosen to extract information from the rounD dataset, a large-scale dataset recorded on three different roundabouts in Germany. The thesis concludes that the spatial properties of a vehicle are a good predictor of the possible future exit on a roundabout. Furthermore, the velocity profiles of the cars taking the same exit are very similar, while the velocity profiles of cars taking different exits are unique. Hence the velocity of a car is also a good predictor of the future behaviour of a car.
